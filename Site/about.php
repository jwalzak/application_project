	<h1>About</h1>
	<p><strong>Hero Burger</strong> is a web and mobile app for anyone who enjoys gaming, fantasy and world-building. We aim to create a product that allows users to generate characters with unique statistics, characteristics and abilities, and either edit those stats or save the ones our application chose for them. This is a fast and intuitive way for users to get their characters built so that they may start playing faster. It eliminates the need for manually dice-rolling stats, and helps those who have trouble thinking of new characters on their own.</p>
	<p>With a user account, user input will be stored in our database so that that the user can sign in and access or edit their creation(s) online through a web browser, or on their phone through the mobile app whenever they want. In addition to simply storing character stats, users can upload a picture of their character, or can use our built-in character avatar creator, a feature unique to our product with artwork made in-house.</p>
